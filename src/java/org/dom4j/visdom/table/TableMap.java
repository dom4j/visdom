/**
 * In a chain of data manipulators some behaviour is common. TableMap
 * provides most of this behavour and can be subclassed by filters
 * that only need to override a handful of specific methods. TableMap
 * implements TableModel by routing all requests to its model, and
 * TableModelListener by routing all events to its listeners. Inserting
 * a TableMap which has not been subclassed into a chain of table filters
 * should have no effect.
